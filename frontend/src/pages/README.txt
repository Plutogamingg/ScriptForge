Purpose: Represents the different pages in the application, each typically corresponding to a route.
Examples:
- `HomePage.js`: The landing page of the app.
- `ProfilePage.js`: User profile page.
Organize these components at the root of `/pages` if they are standalone or in subdirectories for related page groupings.
