Purpose: Contains all reusable UI components of the application.
Examples:
- `common/Button.js`: Standard button used throughout the app.
- `layout/Header.js`: Top navigation header used across different pages.
Structure these components into subdirectories (`common`, `layout`) based on their usage and context.
